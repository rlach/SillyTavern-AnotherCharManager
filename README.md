# SillyTavern-AnotherCharManager

## DISCLAIMER
* I'm not a developer, so yes, my code is not perfect (especially the CSS, I hate that).
* This extension has not been tested on mobile phones, so expect the UI to be unusable on them. I don't intend to work on it, because I'm terrible with UI.

## What is this extension doing?

SillyTavern ACM is an extension which provides a different way to manage your characters.

I've decided to work on it to have something that better suits my needs, because I have way too many characters and most of them are not/poorly tagged.

* With ACM, you can sort by the number of tags characters have, for example, to find those without tags.
* Editing tags on a character does not load their chat, so it won't change the chat recent history.
* You can edit the description, first message, alternative greetings and Creator's notes.
* You can rename, duplicate, delete, export and import characters.
* Access the advanced definitions window.
* Open a character chat.
* Replace the avatar (check prerequisites)

## Prerequisites

This extension has been tested from SillyTavern 1.11.0 to the last stable version.

To be able to use the replace avatar feature, you will need the [SillyTavern-AvatarEdit](https://github.com/sakhavhyand/SillyTavern-AvatarEdit) plugin.

## Installation

Use SillyTavern's third party extension importer to install like any other extension.

## Usage

The extension will add a new button just before the Group button.

But also in the extension menu next to the chat.

Clicking on these buttons will open a pop-up window showing your characters and the number of tags they currently have.

* You can sort alphabetically, number of tags, recent chat or date added.<br/>
* You also have access to a search bar, the Manage Tags menu and import buttons (file and URL).
* Favorites are also highlighted, and you can filter to only display them.

When you select a character, basic information about the character is displayed at the bottom, including its tags, description and greetings(Alternative greetings are read-only).
You can also rename, export, duplicate, delete the selected character among other functionalities.

## Unique Features

A secondary UI is available, allowing you to display your characters groups by custom categories.

* Two defined presets: By Tags and by Author
* Up to five custom presets

You can also resize the window, useful if you have a widescreen monitor.
